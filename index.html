                <h3>Integrity</h3>
                <p>Growing up, I was taught to always do the right thing no matter the situation. I'm someone who must always follow the rules and when
                 something doesn't look right to speak up. I'm also someone who will cheer people up if they are having a bad day. I think having this skill/value
                makes you a reliable person. </p><br>
                <p>I've always had the urge to do the right thing. All the times I've done the wrong thing, I've felt really guilty about 
                    and do my best to fix it and to never do it again.</p>

                <h3>Hard Work</h3>
                <p>If you don't put in the work, the result is not rewarded. My dad is in the military and he has taught me valuable skills in life.
                    He often quotes the Navy seals mantra, "The only easy day is yesterday." meaning each days brings new challenges and opportunities 
                    for growth, and the only way to achieve that growth is to put in the work.
                </p><br>
                <p>I like to find shortcuts to get things done. I realized that if I find a shortcut for everything and not try to overcome the challenge or 
                    then i'll never develop essential and valuable skills.
                </p>

                <h4>Individuality</h4>
                <p>As a creative person, I like seeing individual personalities shine rather than people copying another or following another's steps completely.
                    I think a lot of people have something to give but often get lost in a herd mentality.
                </p><br>
                <p>I've always been different from most people and trying to fit the pattern other people started wasn't working for me. I also didn't want to change who I am 
                    and what I like. I like seeing people as individuals rather than a copy of another person.

                    <h5>Leadership</h5>
                    <p>As someone who tends to hang back and let other people take charge, I realized over time that I like inspiring, guiding, and motivating people. Leadership
                        is a core value that was taught to me through my dad and by people I've met in my life. It's important to me that I can help others.
