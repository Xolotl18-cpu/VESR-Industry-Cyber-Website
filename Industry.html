                <p> The animation industry is growing industry that encompasses various fields like film, television, gaming, and advertising.
                    Animation is a filming technique where still images are manipulated to create moving images. Our industry is focused on 3d animation:
                    the process of creating moving images in a three-dimensional digital space. This craft brings characters, environments, and objects
                    to life in a digital space, using techniques like modeling, rigging, and animating.

                <h3>Career/role:Animator</h3>
                <p>My role would be using digital tools on 2D/3D software or motion capture to produce high-quality visuals. I will also be using computer software and techniques to create frames and sequences that create the illusion of movement.
                Lastly, creating characters, environments, and objects based on scripts and project requirements.

                <h4>Ethical issue</h4>
                <p> One ethical issue the animation industry faces is the portrayal of Diverse and Inclusive Representation. For the longest 
                    time, animation has been dominated by a limited amount of voices and perspectives. Animations 
                    depict a wide range of characters from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities.

                    <h5>Two cybersecurity issues</h5>
                    <p> Two cybersecurity issues the animation industry may face are data breaches and intellect property theft. Data breaches
                    may include leaks on the animation process and loss of data. Intellect property theft is when someone reproduces someone 
                    else's work without the knowledge or permission of the creator and claims it as their own.

                    <h6>Cybersecurity best practices</h6>
                    <p> A couple of good cybersecurity practices are access control and 
                        Training/Education. First, regulating who can access what and at what level. Second, training and
                        educating employees on cybersecurity risks, best practices, and the importance of using strong passwords
                        and encrypting sensitive data.
